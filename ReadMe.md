Make sure to install these additional packages in your conda environment before launching py4web to get GCS working on your end:

pip install nqgcs==0.1.2

pip install pycrypto


There is a folder on my end called private which contains witr_keys.json this folder/file is needed
for uploading. In the video Luca said this folder should be listed in .gitignore as it is private information
The tutor did not help much with it, so I think yall need to create your key and put into a file
called witr_keys.json in private folder. This key will be unique for us to upload to the same bucket.
I added yall as owners so I think yall are able.
